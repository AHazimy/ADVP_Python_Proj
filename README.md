System Overview:

Our system is based on server-client programming :
You need to log in first to be able to use this application.
The data will be transformed as HMAC (hash-based message authentication code).
The HMAC will be generated by the server for the client.

The main libraries used in this app:
	* Opencv.
	* Pyqt5.
	* Pandas.
	* Plotly.
	* Threading.
	* Winsound.
	* Socket.
	* SQLite.
	* HashLib.
	* datetime.
	* Cipherdome.

The main features of the app are:
	* Movement detection with timeline.
	* Clients alert.
	* All data are saved in SQL.Â 
	* An encrypted video is transferred between the server and the client using AES using CBC mode.
	* The application will auto-reconnect in case the connection was lost.
